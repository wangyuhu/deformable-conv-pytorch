# deformable-conv-pytorch
it's a python version file, just import it and enjoying


The models.py is from this project:https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/tree/v1.0, I just did some samll changes.
You can read the No.46-70 lines, and you will know how to use the defom_conv_v2.py.

By the way, do not forget to import this .py file before running!
Good luck!
